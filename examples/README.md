# Examples

In this folder you can find some practical examples using *sportran* to compute the thermal conductivity of a system.

The `data` folder contains the trajectories, obtained from classical NVE molecular dynamics simulations, of a silica glass and a molten NaCl system, that are analysed in the examples.


### Jupyter notebook examples

These examples show how to use the `sportran` package in a Python script, step by step, to analyse a time series and perform cepstral analysis. Some of the tools and plot functions of the code are presented.

* [01 - Silica (single component)](01_example_cepstrum_singlecomp_silica.ipynb): analysis of solid amorphous silica, a one-component system.
* [02 - Liquid NaCl (multi-)](02_example_cepstrum_doublecomp_NaCl.ipynb): analysis of molten NaCl, a two-component system.
* [06 - Liquid h2o (viscosity)](06_example_cesptrum_viscosity_h2o.ipynb) : computation of the shear viscosity of liquid water.

### Command line examples

These examples show how to use the command line program `sportran-analysis` (`analysis.py`) to perform cepstral analysis in a straightforward way. This is an expedient tool to analyse a time series using predefined parameters. Results are produced in the form of several text/binary files and pdf plots.

* [03 - Command-line Silica](03_cmdline_example_silica/): analysis of silica glass, a one-component system.
* [04 - Command-line NaCl](04_cmdline_example_NaCl/): analysis of molten NaCl, a two-component system.
